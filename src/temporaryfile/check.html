                <p>This stress test uses the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Originally created by Cohen et al (1983), it is a highly recognised psychological tool for measuring the perception of stress that's clinically validated and widely used by the NHS and other reputable medical services. It forms part of a wider-ranging self-assessment undertaken by participants of the Be Mindful program, which also includes tests for Depression (PHQ9) and Anxiety (GAD7). <br /> <br />
                    The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measures the degree to which situations in your life are perceived as stressful. The series of questions have been designed to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded you feel your life to be, as well as a direct questione about your current level of experienced stress.
                    The PSS questions ask about thoughts and feelings during the last month. They are easy to understand and are of a general nature. This makes the test relatively free from bias for or against any specific subpopulation group.</p>
